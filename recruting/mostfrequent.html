        <div class ="contianer4">
           <p>The required number of hours that you will be required to work will be between 15 and 40 hours per week. You will have a small quota to meet for how many pots you will need to make per week. This is to ensure that we are able to meet the demands our clients place on us through their orders.</p>

           <p>Is Creativity allowed?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "contianer6">           
           <p>YES!!!! We actively encourage creativity in all of your works as master craftsmen. All that we ask is that you are mindful of the quota and that any creative projects are not too time-consuming compared to other smaller projects. We also encourage you to add your creativity to your quota once you have mastered pot-making in all its criteria.</p>
